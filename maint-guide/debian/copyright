 Private mail from Stéphane Blondon stated:
 .
 These icons comes from the tango project.  There are 2 cases:
 - direct use (= no modification): public domain
 - light modification (colors): it's a derivative work and I keep them
   under the public domain licence.
Commemt:
 Osamu made further changes to some icons using other public domain icons
 from the tango-icon-theme package.
